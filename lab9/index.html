    <h1>Lab 7: Functions</h1>
            <h2> Challenge</h2>
            <p>Working with your partner, experiment with DOM manipulation.</p>
            <h2>Problems</h2>
            <p>Vesper still doesn't know what's going on. We had basic syntax errors and forgot to add the word defer to our script output, so we spent a lot of time trying to figure out why our elements weren't showing up.</p>
            <h2>Results</h2>
            <p>Changing the DOM of the image.</p>
