		<h1>Lab 6: Arrays and Objects</h1>
		<h2> Challenge</h2>
		<p>Working with your partner, experiment with JavaScript arrays and objects.</p>
		<h2>Problems</h2>
		<p>I couldn't find a partner so Nicki told me I could work on my own. I didn't understand the concept of arrays or how they related to variables, so I got an extended deadline, but after asking for help in the lecture I was able to complete the assignment.</p>
		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>Get into this JavaScript file. Here is the program execution.</p>
